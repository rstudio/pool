Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Joe",
             family = "Cheng",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),
             email = "joe@rstudio.com"),
      person(given = "Barbara",
             family = "Borges",

Description: Enables the creation of object pools, which make it
    less computationally expensive to fetch a new object. Currently the
    only supported pooled objects are 'DBI' connections.
